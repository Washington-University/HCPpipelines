Hi Steve,

Can we borrow code from FSL_Nets nets_spectra for the HCP Pipelines under a less restrictive license than the FSL license?  We just want to compute the normalized and unormalized spectra for an input timeseries without the other bells and whistles.  
Thanks,
 
Matt.

Hi - yes of course.  Actually IIRC I didn't really attach a licence to FSLNets yet anyway.

Is it still okay Steve?

Thanks,

Matt.

Oh - doh!  Anyway yes it's fine - let's say I've personally sent you a version free of the licence.
Cheers.

I plan to put only nets_demean.m and nets_spectra* in a folder in the HCP pipelines (our code is BSD licensed), with the attached "license" file summarizing these emails in case anyone recognizes them and wonders about the license situation.  If I missed any dependencies of those files, I will add them also.

I assume by "version free of the license" you meant permissive terms to edit and redistribute, etc (the way copyright works, a work implicitly has all rights reserved to the author or organization only, with no permissions allowed to anyone else).

sure - or you can just attach a BSD licence to those files
