This part of FSL was released as BSD (and/or public domain?) via email April 1, 2021:

Tim Coalson:

I have belatedly realized a similar situation to nets_spectra* exists in read_avw/save_avw, which we have been using in the pipelines for a while (but don't currently provide any indication of license terms).  What kind of licensing terms do you intend the contents of fsl/etc/matlab to have?

...

=====================

Steve Smith:

Hi - from my POV you could use read_avw stuff license free / BSD.  MatthewW/MJ - any objections to that?
Though tbh I don't recall where that code originated from.

Matthew Webster:

Hi All,
  I believe ( although I am not a lawyer! ) that _technically_ everything in the FSL download falls under the FSL license unless specifically over-ridden ( e.g. FSLview, altases, code in extras ). Explicit permission from Steve would certainly count as an override, so all should be fine.

Cheers!
Matthew

Mark Jenkinson:

Hi,

I donâ€™t have any objections.
And I wrote most of the code - certainly the original version.
