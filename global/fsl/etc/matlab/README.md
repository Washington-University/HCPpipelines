# HCP Pipeline Scripts

## global/fsl/etc/matlab directory

This directory contains MATLAB code usually supplied in the ${FSLDIR}/etc/matlab directory
in an FSL installation.

These files were copied from an FSL version 5.0.9 installation. They are available here
so that they can easily be used in the process of compiling MATLAB code used in the HCP
Pipeline Scripts.
