	    # PosData is a list of files (separated by ‘@‘ symbol) having the same phase encoding (PE) direction 
	    # and polarity. Similarly for NegData, which must have the opposite PE polarity of PosData.
	    # The PosData files will come first in the merged data file that forms the input to ‘eddy’.
	    # The particular PE polarity assigned to PosData/NegData is not relevant; the distortion and eddy 
	    # current correction will be accurate either way.
	    #
	    # NOTE that PosData defines the reference space in 'topup' and 'eddy' AND it is assumed that
	    # each scan series begins with a b=0 acquisition, so that the reference space in both
	    # 'topup' and 'eddy' will be defined by the same (initial b=0) volume.
	    #
	    # On Siemens scanners, we typically use 'R>>L' ("RL") as the 'positive' direction for left-right
	    # PE data, and 'P>>A' ("PA") as the 'positive' direction for anterior-posterior PE data.
	    # And conversely, "LR" and "AP" are then the 'negative' direction data.
	    # However, see preceding comment that PosData defines the reference space; so if you want the
	    # first temporally acquired volume to define the reference space, then that series needs to be
	    # the first listed series in PosData.
	    #
	    # Note that only volumes (gradient directions) that have matched Pos/Neg pairs are ultimately
	    # propagated to the final output, *and* these pairs will be averaged to yield a single
	    # volume per pair. This reduces file size by 2x (and thence speeds subsequent processing) and
	    # avoids having volumes with different SNR features/ residual distortions.
