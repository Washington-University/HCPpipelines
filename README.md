# HCP Pipelines 

The HCP Pipelines product is a set of tools (primarily, but not exclusively,
shell scripts) for processing MRI images for the [Human Connectome Project][HCP]. 
Among other things, these tools implement the Minimal Preprocessing Pipeline 
(MPP) described in [Glasser et al. 2013][GlasserEtAl]
